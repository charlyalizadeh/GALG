**EARLY DEVELOPMENT !!**  

# GALG

Personal project on graph theory algorithms vizualization.  
I may push some code that won't compile (usually it will but since it's a personal project I'm not always as rigid as
I should be).
I'm not working on this project anymore, it's fun but I feel like it doesn't learn me anything anymore and there are a lot of thing I want to learn. I may come back to it later (or not, I don't know). It was a good introduction to Makefile and ImGui.
